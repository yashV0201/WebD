block level elements stack on top of each other and are displayed in seperate new lines and margins, heights and paddings can be applied on them.

inline elements for eg. <div> are not displayed in new lines but are displayed in the same line they are used in.(mainly inside of block  level elements). Margins paddings etc. cannot be applied on them.

inline-block elements are a hybrid. they are used as inline objects but margins and paddings etc. can be apploed to them.

"block", "inline","inline-block" are known as Display Types.


columns

columns are self explanatory

mostly used as classes in section element.

column-count is used to define number of columns

column-width is the minimum width for a single column.if the space given is double of column width then there will be 2 columns if required etc.

for changing the formatting of text in the columns as for eg. margins of texts in columns we use p elements of column class eg. .column p{...}
